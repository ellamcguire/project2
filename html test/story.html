            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2007, BoilerBites Culinary Academy emerged from a simple, yet powerful desire: to teach college students the indispensable skill of cooking. Recognizing that many students entering college lacked the fundamental knowledge to prepare healthy, tasty meals for themselves, BoilerBites was born.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At the heart of BoilerBites is a mission to empower students. We believe cooking is not just about nutrition; it's about independence, creativity, and connection. Our classes are designed not only to teach cooking techniques but also to instill confidence and foster a community of food enthusiasts.</p>

            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
            <p>What started in a modest kitchen space on the outskirts of the Purdue University campus has grown into a thriving community. In our early days, we focused on basic cooking techniques and easy-to-prepare recipes. Over the years, we've expanded our curriculum to include a wide range of cuisines, advanced culinary skills, and even courses on food sustainability and ethics.</p>
            <p>Throughout our journey, we've been guided by feedback from our students, evolving to meet their changing needs and interests. Today, BoilerBites Culinary Academy stands as a testament to the power of community and the joy of cooking. We continue to welcome new students each semester, eager to embark on their culinary adventures with us.</p>
